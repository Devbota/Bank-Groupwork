Project Overview
This web-based banking application is designed for NeXTSafe Bank to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for users to manage their accounts and perform financial transactions. The project is built using the Flask web framework in Python and ensures security through various techniques such as password hashing, salting, and encryption.

The application supports two types of users:

Users who can perform basic banking operations such as login, checking balances, viewing transaction history, and making withdrawals or deposits.
Admins who can manage users, access security logs, and oversee the entire banking system.
